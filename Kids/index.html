      <p class="style3" >The  game for school children and beginners
        alike!</p>
      <p class="style3">A non-contact, non-confrontation competitive
        game using a mallet and balls to hit around a set course of hoops.</p>
      <p class="style3">It has elements of other of other sports
        such as golf and snooker - hitting at a large target, hitting to a position,
        hitting other balls - and develops good hand-eye coordination.</p>
      <p class="style3">A game designed for both primary and secondary 
          schools but has been so successful that it is now being used by many
        croquet clubs for teaching beginners!</p>
      <p class="style3">It&#146;s quick, it&#146;s fun and it&#146;s
        a great was to get started in the world of croquet</p>
      <p class="style3">Does your school want to know more? <a href="../Where_To_Play_Croquet/index.html">Click 
        here for details of your State Headquarters</a> and they can quickly put 
        you through to your nearest croquet club.</p>
      <p class="style3">Left school a few (or more) years ago? 
        But would really like an opportunity to get involved in a great game, 
        get outdoors, take some exercise and play a game that asks you to think 
        as well as do?</p>
      <p align="center" class="  "><img src="frog2.jpg" width="400" height="240" /></p>
      <p align="center" class="style3">Get with Croaky the frog 
        and Play Aussie Croquet  
      </p><h2 align="left" class="  ">How to Set Out an Aussie Croquet Court</h2>
      <p align="left" class="style3">The hoops and peg are laid out as for Association Croquet.      
      </p><p align="center" class="   "><em><br />
        </em><img src="aussie-court.jpg" width="415" height="574" />
      </p><p align="left" class="style3">If you do not have room for a full court
        then you can scale  it down. Use six units for the length, and four for
        the width. The corner  hoops (1 to 4) are one unit from each boundary;
        hoops 5 and 6 one unit  either side of the peg.
      </p><h2 align="left" class="  ">The Course</h2>
      <p align="left" class="style3">The path along which your ball has to travel starts with 
        hoop 1 (the blue-topped one) and has to follow the set order through to 
        hoop 6, and then hit the centre peg. The dotted line and arrows on the 
        diagram show the direction each ball must go to score each hoop. 
      </p><h2 align="left" class="  ">How to Play Aussie Croquet</h2>
      <h3 align="left" class="  ">To Start the Game</h3>
      <ul >
        <li class="style3">Four players</li>
        <li class="style3">Choose partners</li>
        <li class="style3">Toss a coin to decide which pair go first</li>
        <li class="style3"><font color="#0000A0">BLUE</font> and BLACK play against <font color="#FF0000">RED</font> 
          and <font color="#FFFF00">YELLOW</font></li>
        <li class="style3">The partners winning the toss play with BLUE and BLACK</li>
        <li class="style3">Each player plays the same colour ball for the whole game</li>
        <li class="style3">The order you play is painted on the peg: <font color="#0000A0">BLUE</font>, 
          BLACK, <font color="#FF0000">RED</font> and <font color="#FFFF00">YELLOW</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="style3">Time allowed is 30 minutes.</p>
      <h3 class="  ">To Score</h3>
      <p class="style3">Count one point for every hoop each ball runs through in order and one 
        for hitting the peg. The winners are the team with the highest score.</p>
      <h3 class="  ">To Play</h3>
      <p class="style3">Starting: Place each ball in turn halfway through the first hoop for 
        an easy start.</p>
      <p class="style3">Each turn is only ONE hit ... <em>unless you earn an extra hit!</em></p>
      <p class="style3">An <em>extra hit</em> is earned when you:</p>
      <ul >
        <li class="style3">hit your ball through the next hoop in order</li>
        <li class="style3">when you hit any of the other three balls with your ball. (You can 
          only hit each other ball once per turn unless you go through the next 
          hoop - then you can hit them all again.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="style3">If you hit two balls in the same stroke, the hit on the first ball is 
        the only one that counts.</p>
      <p class="style3">If a ball scores a hoop and continues on to hit another ball, the hoop 
        score counts and the player gets only one extra stroke for hitting the 
        ball after the hoop is scored.</p>
      <p class="style3">If a ball goes over the boundary it is measured in the length of a mallet 
        handle.</p>
      <p class="style3">Some Tactics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="style3">Your partner or opponent can hit your ball through your hoop - you 
          score the point.</li>
        <li class="style3">You can hit your opponent back out of a hoop if they've not gone all 
          the way through.</li>
        <li class="style3">Your ball can go through the hoop the wrong way to get to the right 
          side - but it doesn't score a point.</li>
        <li class="style3">You can hit your partner ball into a better position - or an opponent 
          ball out of position.</li>
        <li class="style3">You can gently hit your ball into, or off the sides of, the other 
          three balls to finally position your ball to go through a hoop.</li>
      </ul>
