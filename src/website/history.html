      <h2>The Middle Ages </h2>
      <p class="style3">The first known mallet and ball games were played in England and Europe 
        during the middle ages; one game known as &quot;Pall Mall&quot; was played 
        in London and from which the well known street is named. These games usually 
        involved hitting a single ball through very wide hoops. </p>
      <h2> The Present Game </h2>
      <p class="style3">The modern game is quite different and is reputed to have started in 
        Ireland and taken to England during the 18/50s. No-one seems to know how 
        it started in Ireland! It became an instant success, one reason being 
        because it provided the first opportunity for women to participate in 
        an outdoor sport on an equal basis with men. Over the next 30 years uniform 
        rules were established and national competitions commenced. </p>
      <p class="style3">The first national headquarters was the Wimbledon All England Croquet 
        Club in what was later to become the Wimbledon All England Lawn Tennis 
        and Croquet Club. </p>
      <p class="style3">The game spread rapidly in particular to Australia and New Zealand and 
        many other British colonies, but well before the end of the century it 
        had become overshadowed by the introduction of another new game - lawn 
        tennis! </p>
      <h2>Where Has It Got To?</h2>
      <p class="style3">At the start of the 21st century, the major croquet playing countries 
        are Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the USA. </p>
      <p class="style3">In Australia, for example, there are nearly 7,000 registered players 
        which is a similar number to Olympic sports such as boxing and rowing. 
      </p>
      <p class="style4"><span class="style3">On the subject of the Olympics, croquet was played in the 1900 Olympics. </span> </p>
      <p class="style3">Over 20 countries are now members of the World Croquet Federation and 
        the game is found is countries such as:</p>
       
      <ul>
        <li class="style3">Japan
              - where a similar game but using teams of 5 players called <a href="http://gateball.com.au/">gateball</a> is
              also played</li>
        <li class="style3">Egypt
              - where the main game is golf croquet which is a simplified form
          of Association croquet </li>
        <li class="style3"> Russia
              - Tolstoy had a court in his garden in Moscow and the astronauts
          are reported to have played as a relaxation on their return from space </li>
        <li class="style3"> China
              - where it is played by many people of different age groups; a
          picture in the Illustrated London News of 1938 showed Revolutionary
          guards playing the game! </li>
      </ul>      <p class="style4"><span class="style3">In the USA, two forms of the game are played, Association croquet and 
            American rules. The latter uses the same equipment and lawn lay-out, but 
            has a number of variations to the Association croquet rules. Many of the 
            top players in America play both games. In addition there are some garden 
            sets which have 9 hoops and 2 pegs!</span> </p>      <p class="style3">America also boats some of the most well know croquet fanatics such as 
          Samuel Goldwyn, Tyrone Power, Averell Harriman and Harpo Marx. </p>      <p class="style3">Interest in croquet has fluctuated during this century however of the 
          last 20 years there has been a resurgence of interest especially by younger 
          people who have seen the challenge of the sport and who now dominate at 
          the international level. </p>      <h2>In Australia</h2>      <p class="style3">The earliest evidence of the game being played in Australia was advertisements 
          in the Tasmanian 'Walch's Literal Intellegencer in 1861 and photos of 
          play at Government House in Perth in about 1863. Apart from the group 
          based at Perth's Government House. the first croquet club was formed in 
          Kyneton, Victoria in 1866 and a year later a club was formed at Kapunda, 
          the then second largest town in South Australia. </p>      <h3>State Associations</h3>      <p class="style3">The first State Association to be formed was in Tasmania in 1908. Other 
          States followed with Victoria in 1914, South Australia in 1916, New South 
          Wales in 1918, Queensland in 1922 and Western Australia in 1928. </p>      <h3>National</h3>      <p class="style3">In September 1949 the National Championships were held in Brisbane and 
          the representatives from all the States decided to form the Australian 
          Croquet Council to conduct the Australian Championships and represent 
          Australian croquet overseas. Until then, the national teams had always 
          been selected by the Victorian State Association, the largest of the State 
          bodies. </p>      <p class="style3">In 1987 the Council became the Australian
          Croquet Association and in 1992 commenced operating under the name
          trade name of &quot;Croquet Australia&quot;. </p>      <p class="style3">Membership throughout Australia has grown to nearly 7,000 although in 
          addition there are many unaffiliated players who play garden croquet.
