  <p align="left"><em style="font-size: 12px">Note regarding Knock-Out: Due to a handicap transgression by Doug Leabeater, Doug was excluded   from competing in the finals. The transgression occurred through his   misunderstanding of the handicapping system, however the decision was   made in fairness to the other players. His replacement Margaret Brockett   was moved into the semi-finals, but withdrew before the commencement   of play, due to illness. Vic Gleeson was next in order, and therefore   became the fourth player in the semi-finals knockout.</em></p>
