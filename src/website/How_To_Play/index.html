      <h2 class="   ">INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p class="style3">The image of croquet varies between 
        the 19th century garden parties with ladies dressed in crinolines and 
        the game being played by the Queen and Alice in Alice in Wonderland with 
        flamingoes as the mallets and hedgehogs as the balls. Neither of these 
        have to do with the modern game of Association Croquet.</p>
      <h2 class="   ">THE GAME ITSELF - THE BASICS</h2>
      <p class="style3">The game is played on a level court 
        about the size of two tennis courts between 2 or 4 (doubles) players. 
        With the aid of different coloured sets of balls two or even three games 
        can be played on a lawn simultaneously.</p>
      <p class="style3">Each player has two balls. The aim 
        is to make each ball pass through each of the hoops in order and hit the 
        peg in the centre of the court. As the diagram shows, the balls must go 
        through each hoop twice, once in each direction.</p>
      <p class="style3">In Club and Championship, the hoops 
        are less than 5mm wider than the ball, it is therefore important to have 
        the balls very close to the hoops before you attempt to run the hoop.        </p>
      <p class="style3">Clips which match
          the colour of the balls are used to indicate the next hoop to be &quot;made&quot; by
        each ball.</p>
      <p class="style3">When it is your turn, you may play 
        either of your two balls. If you can make it hit (roquet) any of the other 
        three balls you earn yourself two further shots. For the first of these 
        two extra shots, your ball is picked up and placed against the ball which 
        it hit. It is this two ball (croquet) shot which gives the game its name 
        and makes it unique amongst ball sports.</p>
      <p class="style3">Each of the three balls can be used 
        only once (to gain extra shots by hitting it) before making a hoop. You
        also get an extra shot when your ball goes through its correct hoop,
        and you can then use all the balls again. In this way, experienced players
        can extend their &quot;break&quot; to over ninety strokes.</p>
      <h2 class="   ">NOW SOME MORE DETAILS</h2>
      <p class="style3">The colours of the balls are blue 
        and black versus red and yellow. Secondary balls which allow a separate 
        game to be played on the same court, are green and brown versus pink and 
        white.</p>
      <p class="style3">Tactics are a very important element 
        in croquet so as ti make it easier for you to make a break but harder 
        for your opponent. It is important therefore that at the end of your turn 
        you leave your balls where your opponent cannot easily use them.</p>
      <p class="style3">In doubles play, players take one 
        ball each and play as partners.</p>
      <p class="style3">Because a high level of physical 
        fitness is not required, the game can be played on an even footing by 
        young and old, male and female.</p>
      <p class="style3">The scoring is based on one point 
        for every time you balls run a hoop or hits the peg in order - 26 in all. 
        Games can either be played until they finish or to a specific time limit 
        eg 2 hours.</p>
      <p class="style3">A handicap system operates which 
        allows players of different standards to compete on equal terms. The
        handicap  range is from -3 to 24.</p>
      <h2 class="   ">UNIQUE FEATURES</h2>
      <p class="style3">The game is unique and contain elements 
        and skills from a number of other sports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="style3"><i>billiards</i> the skill in making a ball
          hit another so that they move in different, but specific directions
        and the ability to extend the player&#146;s time on the court by making &quot;breaks&quot; </li>
        <li class="style3"><i>golf</i> accurate
          single ball strokes are needed as with putting </li>
        <li class="style3"><i>bowls</i> an outdoor
          sport subject to lawn conditions and the weather </li>
        <li class="style3"><i>chess</i> much depends
          on the player&#146;s tactical skills. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="   ">LAWS OF THE GAME</h2>
      <p class="style3">The laws of Association Croquet are 
        determined by the national bodies of the four main croquet playing countries 
        - Australia, New Zealand, the USA and the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p class="style3">There are
          a number of modified games such as <a href="../Golf_Croquet/The Rules of Golf Croquet (ACA) - Effective 1 January 2014docx.pdf"target="_blank">Golf Croquet,</a> <a href="../Kids/index.html">Aussie Croquet</a> and
          short croquet which may be played. Many people who play &#145;<a href="http://www.wcfcroquet.org/Rules/The_WCF_Rules_of_Garden_Croquet.pdf">garden croquet</a>&#146; use
        their own informal and simplified rules.</p>
      <p class="style3">In the USA,
          some croquet is played using &quot;American&quot; rules which differ
          in a number of respects from Association Croquet although the equipment
        and court layout remains the same.</p>
      <h2 class="   ">DIAGRAM OF THE COURT</h2>
      <p class="style3">Below is a diagram of the court which 
        shows the way the balls are required to travel through the hoops.</p>
