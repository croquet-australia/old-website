                                            <p>[29 Oct] The ACA Executive Committee is asking players to apply for Appointed Officer positions. There are a variety of roles requiring differing levels of experience, leadership and passion. Responsibilities are listed in By-Law 28 of the Handbook.</p>

                                            <p>Over the past few months the Executive has been reviewing the process by which Appointed Officers are endorsed and the timing of such appointments. </p>

                                            <p>Council agreed at its September meeting in Adelaide that Officers will commence their duties from the beginning of a calendar year rather than sometime after an AGM.</p>

                                            <p>There are several advantages in asking for expressions of interest in October and having appointments made by the end of November as this will give the successful appointee the opportunity to prepare a program in consultation with the Executive and discuss any financial implications with the Treasurer prior to the adoption of the ACA's annual budget</p>

                                            <p>It should be noted that all positions fall vacant each December.</p>
