      <h2><strong>Latest News</strong></h2>
      <p><strong>Do you know if the  drugs you take are allowable or restricted in a sporting context?</strong></p>
      <p>The  Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority has an interactive tool which enables a  player to check the status of medications and other substances which s/he may  consume. There is a sports specific &lsquo;croquet&rsquo; category. </p>
      <p>The  list changes annually, so croquet athletes, you can re-check the status of your  medications at any time by referring to the <a href="https://checksubstances.asada.gov.au/" target="_blank">Check  Your Substances tool</a> on the ASADA website.      </p>
      <p><strong>The World Anti-Doping  Agency Prohibited List 2012 has been released. </strong>The <a href="https://checksubstances.asada.gov.au/" target="_blank">Check  Your Substances tool</a> will be updated to reflect the 2012 changes on 23 December 2011. The major change to the 2012 List which will affect Australian athletes  and support personnel is to inhaled  formoterol. This is a bronchodilator which  causes the widening of vessels by relaxing the smooth muscles surrounding them.</p>
      <p>Also in its announcement of the 2012 List, WADA  advised that, &ldquo;The List prohibits the administration of all beta-2 agonists  except salbutamol (maximum 1600 micrograms over 24 hours), salmeterol when  taken by inhalation, and now formoterol (maximum 36 micrograms taken over 24  hours).&rdquo;  NB beta-2 agonists are used in  the treatment of night time asthma, emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The use  of inhalers for these substances is allowed but with specific approval, however,  injected or ingested (tablets) beta-2 is prohibited.</p>
      <p><strong>Other matters to note!</strong><br />
        WADA  also has a monitoring program that focuses on substances which are not on the  Prohibited List, but which it wishes to monitor in order to detect patterns of  misuse in sport. WADA has confirmed that in 2012 it will be  monitoring the effects nicotine can have on performance when taken in oral  tobacco products such as snus. WADA stressed that it was not the Agency&rsquo;s  intention to target smokers.</p>
      <p>Further information about the new Prohibited List and  many other drugs in sport related matters can be found on the Australian Sports  Anti-Doping Authority <a href="http://www.asada.gov.au/" target="_blank">website</a> and WADA <a href="http://www.wada-ama.org/en/World-Anti-Doping-Program/Sports-and-Anti-Doping-Organizations/International-Standards/Prohibited-List/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
