            <h2>Neil White<br />
              (President)</h2>
            <p>Neil  is a member of Brighton club in South Australia.  He commenced playing croquet at South Terrace  club in the late 1990&rsquo;s and filled the roles of Secretary and President.  Whilst at South Terrace he took on the task  of organising inter-club Golf Croquet competitions in South Australia and  chaired the initial Golf Croquet committee for SACA.  With changes in residences Neil moved to  Holdfast Bay Club and later to Brighton.</p>
            <p>Neil  captained SA&rsquo;s initial interstate Golf Croquet team which competed in  Newcastle.</p>
            <p>Neil  held the position of President of SACA for two years, a position that he  relinquished to take up the VP role on the ACA.   He has concentrated on Golf Croquet in recent years as there are only 7  days in the week. </p>
            <p>Neil  sees the introduction of Skype meetings as the way of involving more members in  the workings of the ACA without breaking the budget and the Executive committee  now meets monthly via this medium.</p>
            <p>Neil&rsquo;s  main interest outside croquet (is there anything outside croquet??) is travel  and he and his wife, Heather travel as frequently as possible. </p>

            <p>In  his latter working years he had his own consulting company and specialised in  general management, public communication and strategic planning in the  agribusiness sector.</p>

            <p>Megan has  played at Moorabinda Croquet Club in Bunbury WA for 8 years, where she is  currently President.  What attracted her  to the sport was the challenge it posed - mental and physical - and the  friendly banter around the afternoon tea table afterwards.  </p>
            <p>She firmly  believes that solid, friendly clubs are the best foundation for the building of  sports.  She is passionate about women's  croquet, and seeing the great croquet facilities we have being used by local  community groups (of course with the notion of roping more members in!).</p>
            <p>Representing  WA in Association Croquet is a highlight of her year. She is married to Kim,  who has represented WA in Golf Croquet for 7 years.</p>
          <p>Other  'pastimes' include running a school library and spending time enjoying the  south west in orienteering or mountain biking. </p></td>
