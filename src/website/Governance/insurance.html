	<p>Regional  Insurance Brokers is proud to be in partnership with the Australian Croquet  Association as<br />
its  official corporate insurance broker.</p>
    <p>Regional  has been working in close partnership with the sports and leisure industry in  Australia for<br />
      many  years. This experience has enabled Regional to develop an insurance and risk  protection<br />
      program  that specifically meets the needs of the Australian Croquet Association. We are  able to<br />
      identify  and address the association&rsquo;s risk exposures and in conjunction with various  insurers,<br />
      provide  a comprehensive insurance program that is specifically targeted to the sport of  croquet.</p>
    <p>We  recognise the importance of working alongside our clients to develop an  insurance solution that<br />
      addresses  your physical, legal and financial risks.</p>
    <p>The  Australian Croquet Association currently has cover in place for the following  risks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Public  and Products Liability</li>
      <li>Professional  Indemnity</li>
      <li>Management  Liability</li>
      <li>Corporate  Travel</li>
      <li>Personal  Accident*</li>
    </ul>
    <p>*Please  note that the level of cover under this program is not &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; and as  such we<br />
      recommend  that all participants take out private health, life and income protection  insurance<br />
      according  to their own individual needs and circumstances. It is an individual&rsquo;s  responsibility to<br />
      ensure  that he/she has adequate cover for his/her specific needs.</p>
    <p>Other  covers available on an individual club basis:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Damage  to buildings, contents and stock</li>
      <li>Theft</li>
      <li>Malicious  damage to playing fields</li>
      <li>Machinery  Breakdown</li>
      <li>Glass</li>
      <li>Electronic  Equipment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If  you would like further information regarding any insurance matters or a  quotation, please contact<br />
      Regional  Insurance Brokers on (07) 3847 0400 or email <a href="mailto:sq@ribpl.com.au">sq@ribpl.com.au</a></p>
    <p><strong>PRODUCT INFORMATION</strong></p>
    <p>Please  refer to the policy schedule and insurer policy wordings for full details  regarding the specific<br />
      terms,  conditions and exclusions of each policy.</p>
    <p>Please  contact Regional on 1300 500 441 if you require further information or to  request a copy of<br />
      the  policy schedule and/or policy wordings.</p>
    <p><strong>Public Liability</strong></p>
    <p>Public  liability insurance is designed to protect you against losses that you become  legally liable to<br />
      pay  as compensation in respect of personal injury and/or property damage that  occurs as a result of<br />
      your  club&rsquo;s business.</p>
    <p>Club  business includes activities associated with the administration, promotion,  organisation and<br />
      provision  of croquet. This includes the ownership or occupation of your premises, and  fundraising<br />
      events.</p>
    <p><strong>Professional Indemnity</strong></p>
    <p>This  policy will cover you against losses arising out of a claim against you arising  out of a breach of<br />
      professional  duty including negligent acts and advice in the conduct of the club business.</p>
    <p><strong>Management Liability</strong></p>
    <p>Management  liability insurance provides cover against the exposures and unintentional<br />
      wrongdoings  that your club may face. This includes discrimination, harassment, inefficient<br />
      administration,  libel and slander, and employee theft.</p>
    <p>This  policy provides cover to the elected officers and incorporated sporting clubs  for losses arising<br />
      from  claims against the officer/sporting club for wrongful acts that have been  committed in the<br />
      conduct  of club business.</p>
    <p>The  policy includes the following coverage sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Directors  and Officers Liability</li>
      <li>Employment  Practices Liability</li>
      <li>Internet  Liability</li>
      <li>Statutory  Liability</li>
      <li>Fidelity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Personal Accident</strong><br />
      This  policy provides coverage for members that are injured whilst participating in  official club<br />
      matches,  and whilst travelling to or from official club activities. The policy generally  provides cover<br />
      in  three key areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Capital  Benefits</li>
      <li>Non-Medicare  Medical Benefits</li>
      <li>Loss of  Income</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>FREQUENTLY </strong><strong>ASKED</strong><strong> QUESTIONS</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Are volunteers covered?</strong></p>
    <p>The  personal accident policy includes cover for volunteers at the club carrying out  general<br />
      maintenance  duties such as gardening.</p>
    <p><strong>Does our liability policy cover club activities such as sausage  sizzle fundraisers at third party sites?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes.  The policy automatically provides cover for basic fundraising activities.</p>
    <p><strong>Are we insured if our club hires out our facilities to third  parties?</strong></p>
    <p>If  your club hires out its facilities to third parties for activities other than  your own, then there is a<br />
      requirement  for you to ensure that those who use your facilities have their own liability  insurance.<br />
      This  can easily be confirmed by requesting that the third party supplies you with a  certificate of<br />
      currency  for their liability insurance as proof of cover.</p>
    <p><strong>Is there a requirement to wear footwear whilst playing?</strong></p>
    <p>Whilst  there is no insurance requirement for footwear to be worn during matches, we  recommend<br />
      that  you implement and follow an effective risk management policy.<br />
      Some  clubs have policies and procedures in place that require you to have footwear  on at all times<br />
      and  we recommend your abide by their policies.</p>
    <p><strong>Is there a weather policy that we must comply with?</strong></p>
    <p>We  recommend that you follow your local state or territory governing policy.</p>
    <p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Risk Management</strong></p>
    <p>Risk  Management assists you identity, prioritise and address risks that will affect  the future of your<br />
      club  and its members.</p>
    <p>Each  and every club must ensure that they have implemented a suitable program which  provides a<br />
      systematic  approach to managing risk. The program should address physical, legal and  financial risk,<br />
      particularly  in areas such as safety of both people and property, and compliance.</p>
    <p>The  development of an effective risk management program is an on-going process, and  must be<br />
      continually  monitored and reviewed to ensure that it meets your clubs individual needs.</p>
    <p>Effective  risk management ultimately means quality assurance for all of your players,  coaches,<br />
      volunteers  and spectators.</p>
