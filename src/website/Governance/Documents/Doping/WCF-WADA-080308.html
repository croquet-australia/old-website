      <p><strong>WCF Notice<br />
      </strong><strong>6 th March 2008</strong></p>
      <p class="style3">The revised version of the World Anti-Doping Code has been published by the World Anti-Doping Agency. The Code, which was approved last November at the World Conference on Doping in Sport after an 18 month period of consultation, will come into force on 1 January 2009. <br />
          <br />
  This will directly affect those WCF Member Associations who have agreed an Anti-Doping policy with their respective National Anti-Doping Organisation. <br />
  <br />
  To date that includes:- <br />
  The New Zealand Croquet Council; <br />
  The Australian Croquet Association; <br />
  The Croquet Association of Ireland . <br />
  <br />
  The new Code builds on the existing version, which has been in place since 2004. Once again it is accompanied by a set of International Standards containing more detailed requirements within certain areas of operation. The major changes in the new Code include: <br />
  <br />
  The potential for increased sanctions above the standard two-year period of ineligibility, up to four years in cases of 'aggravated circumstances', for example if the athlete is found to have used multiple prohibited substances or if they obstruct the detection of adjudication process. <br />
  <br />
  The potential for an athlete to lower their period of ineligibility in exchange for information against others which results in the discovery of an anti-doping rule violation or a criminal offence. <br />
  <br />
  All substances on the List of Prohibited Substances and Methods to be classified as Specified Substances, other than hormones, steroids and certain stimulants. <br />
  <br />
  The acceleration of the management of doping cases both through the mandatory suspension of an athlete following an adverse analytical finding in an A sample (for non-Specified Substances). <br />
  <br />
  National Anti-Doping Organisations having the mandatory right to appeal decisions made by all national governing bodies with regards to sanctions on athletes for anti-doping rule violations. <br />
