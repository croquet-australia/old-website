            <p><strong>Your role as a coach</strong></p>
            <p>Coaching is an important role and must be taken seriously. You must be committed, reliable, understanding and patient. You are a role model and need to be professional at all times. </p>
            <p>You must have an agenda that is well planned and has clear objectives. Your students needs to feel welcomed, important and they must have your full attention at all times. You must remain calm and be in control.</p>
            <p>You don’t have to be a good player to be a good Coach. If you are organised confident and in control of your sessions, you will earn the respect of your students and they will respond positively. You must remain positive at all times and establish  an environment where students are comfortable to ask questions and  take risks.</p>
            <p>As a coach, your students are your responsibility. There is no greater satisfaction than watching students develop under your direction and guidance. This is what makes coaching so rewarding.</p>
