      </strong></span>      
        <p class="style3">This Ruling is to apply to the application of Law 16(a) in all events held under the auspices of the ACA, and State, Regional and Club events. </p>
        <p class="style3"> It is recommended that the clause to be ignored be lined through in copies of the Australian Laws Book, and a note made &ldquo;ACA LC Ruling, September, 2009.</p>
        <h2 class="style3">Rationale: </h2>
        <p class="style3">Laws 16(a) currently states &ldquo;A roquet may be made by the striker&rsquo;s ball on any live ball, unless the striker is already required to take croquet.&rdquo; If this were so, it follows that if a striker fails to take croquet when required to do so [Law 27(f)], he cannot play a stroke and &lsquo;roquet&rsquo; a live ball. If he attempted to cause the striker&rsquo;s ball to hit a live ball and the attempt was successful, it would not be a roquet. If play was forestalled and the error rectified, his turn would end under Law 4(d)(1). </p>
        <p class="style3">This provision in Law 16(a) is contradicted by the intent of Law 27(f) as expressed in ORLC Part D - Commentary. In the Commentary 27.6.1 [re Law 27(f)], mention is made of strokes that could be played (in error) instead of the striker taking croquet when required to do so &ndash; &ldquo;(e.g. attempts to roquet the same ball again or another ball or. . . .)&rdquo;. If play was forestalled and the error rectified, such a stroke, if unsuccessful, would result in end of turn. If such a stroke was successful, &ldquo;The striker would remain entitled to play unless his turn ended under Law 4(d) during a stroke in error.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="style3">The ACA representative on the ILC has been notified of this contradiction, and the ILC is considering a solution. </p>
        <p class="style3"><em>Nell Hass <br />
        Chairman ACA Laws Committee.</em></p>
