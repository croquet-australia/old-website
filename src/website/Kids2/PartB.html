      <h3 align="center"><strong>ACA DRAFT SCHOOL  COACHING SYSTEM</strong></h3>
      <h3 align="center"><strong>PART B : THE PROGRAMS</strong></h3>
      <h3 align="center"><strong>MALLETSPORTS AND SCHOOLS  CURRICULUM</strong></h3>
      <p>I  have not included the enormous amount of literature that relates to the issues  of learning and schools.  The National  Curriculum is not yet complete, but the Victorian VELS is well established. The  following is a discussion of how we can explain that Malletsports can tie up to  the VELS of Victoria.</p>
      <p>The  VELS (Victorian Essential Learning Standards)<br />
        We  believe that Malletsports will be useful in several of the VELS and has a role  to play in all three strands, Physical, Personal and Social Learning,  Discipline Based Learning and Interdisciplinary Learning.</p>
      <p>Physical,  Personal and Social Learning : Our program will help students in :<br />
        Health  and Physical Education : The benefits here are of a gentle sport for many  students who do not want to energise.<br />
        Personal  Learning : In Malletsports, students have a gradual pathway to becoming their  own learners, and being able to stand as individuals amidst Group Dynamics.<br />
        Interpersonal  Development.  Group Dynamics and  understanding the diversity of people in teams are important to personal  growth. In Malletsports, there are opportunities to sometimes follow, sometimes  lead, but always with a view to a Student gaining their own selfhood.</p>
      <p>Discipline  Based Learning : Not everyone copes with Discipline based learning and there  are many skills a student can only get to success with by gradually learning to  discipline the mind.  This may help in  other area, which also require concentration and persistance.      </p>
      <p>Malletsports  have natural uses in <br />
        The  Arts : this teaches visualisation, production and planning skills, and allows  creative solution finding<br />
        Language  : Some of our variants reward the players with letters and Works gained when  going through a hoop, and these are fun ways to start of learning reading and  word skills.  Later, the complexity of  written Malletsports material can be challenging.<br />
        The  Humanities<br />
      Mathematics  : Malletsports contains mathematics galore, and students will gradually find  that what they learn in class is useful on the croquet court, and what they  learn on the croquet court is useful in class.      </p>
      <p>Malletsports  is a great arena for Interdisciplinary Learning:<br />
        Communication  : Whether for an individual player or a team, a student in Malletsports will  learn about effective communication.<br />
        Design  : Students will be encouraged to design and create their own patterns of ball  movement.  This is challenging, and can  lead to greater design skills.<br />
        Creativity  : The problem solving in Malletsports may add layers of thinking which are  often untapped.  For Creativity, the  sport may benefit a student greatly.<br />
      Thinking  : Malletsports requires many different types of thinking, from logic to  intuitive, from left to right hemisphere, and to co-ordination of both  hemispheres.  </p>
      <p>Again,  our sport has a unique complex shot, the two ball shot, which may help lay down  beneficial neural pathways.</p>
      <h3><strong>SAMPLE MALLETSPORTS  PRESCHOOL AND SCHOOLS PROGRAMS</strong></h3>
<p>GOAL  : TO get Children playing malletsports in a lifelong learning environment.</p>
      <p>A  program which can be used in both Schools and Active After Schools</p>
      <p>Utilising  : Group and Individual Discovery Learning, based on some Skills Acquisition and  Problem Solving.  </p>
      <p>Conforming  to and adding to : National Curriculum, as developed for the Victorian  Essential Learning Standards.</p>
      <p><strong>MALLETSPORTS ADVANTAGES  :</strong> <br />
        <strong>POINT OF DIFFERENCE : </strong>Our  Unique Two ball shot, which may have brain and personality positives with 2  hemisphere development and co-ordination.</p>
      <p><strong>TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC  ADJUNCT :</strong> <br />
        Variants  to teach deep problem solving through to variants which are Slowed Down  versions of many other grab and stash sports.   The Deliberation means the strategies employed in other sports can be  observed and discussed at the same time they are played.  This is a great advantage to games such as  Football.</p>
      <p>In  terms of the Active After-Schools Community Program, we have target activities  and game, and invasion activities and games, as well as co-operative activities  and games.</p>
      <p><strong>PHYSICS AND GEOMETRY  PROBLEM SOLVING :</strong> Malletsports involves  some very complex ball production skills, which can teach a great deal about  the physical world, and the theory of mathematics.  There are also many opportunities for  discipline learning.</p>
      <p><strong>A PARTNERSHIP WITH  SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS : </strong> <br />
        Our  program aims to also ensure that Schools and Teachers can continue with  Students who want to keep going in the sport.   Clubs will also provide coaching and attempt to ensure that there are  critical mass groups of like minded young people.</p>
      <p>We  recognise that to get a participant from Beginner to Top Player can be between  40 and 200 coaching sessions.  </p>
      <p>However,  young players from Victoria have now played at the very top levels of Croquet,  and are currently amongst the top players in the world.</p>

      <p><strong>THE PROGRAMS</strong> <br />
        We  have 7 week programs, which get the participant  able to continue playing a game.<br />
        The  basics of the programs :<br />
        <strong>Preschool Program :</strong> &nbsp;(Also Active After Schools for beginners)&nbsp; This program is&nbsp;just  about getting competence. &nbsp;No competition, and no aggression. &nbsp;Two  ball shot is shown as play. &nbsp;Adventure and mini-croquet courses. Animals  as Hoops.<br />
  <img src="Images/PartB_clip_image003.gif" alt=""  />    </p>
      <p>0 to 3 :   Babies are happy to watch things move around, and touch and occasionally  push.  At 1.5, they can hit a mallet onto  a ball in controlled conditions. At 2 they roll balls around a simple table top  train set.  They are happy constructing  and knocking down.  Just hitting mallets  on balls, rolling balls and watching and enjoying.<br />
        At 2.5, they can see the two ball shot in  action.<br />
        At 3 : hitting the ball with the mallets  around a circuit of pool spaghetti. They can hit the two ball shot in a very  controlled toy. <br />
        For the 4 and 5 year olds, they can be out  playing on Mini Croquet Course. </p>
<p>We  need to create the right toys for this age group.</p>
      <p>At  Brunswick, I use Wacka and Cracka as Coaches for this age group.  Wacka and Cracka are two wombat characters  we have had for years at Brunswick Malletsports Club.</p>
      <p><img src="Images/PartB_clip_image005.gif" alt=""  /></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img src="Images/PartB_clip_image009.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <p><img src="Images/PartB_clip_image011.jpg" alt="" /><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Primary Program One  :&nbsp;(Also Active After Schools)</strong> &nbsp;6 to 8  years old :<br />
        Adventure  and Mini, then&nbsp;A game of Long and Short, with some play of two ball shots.  &nbsp;A two ball track is worked with for aim and shot production. No  competition no aggression. &nbsp;Determination OK.<br />
      (The  Long and Short of it : Each player gets One Long Shot to establish a spot  somewhere near the next hoop. </p>
      <img src="Images/PartB_clip_image013.jpg" alt="" />
<p> All players do this, then they go to the Hoop  and one by one, they make their way to the hoop and through, counting the  shots.  They are in Pairs, so a player  may nudge the partner closer, to reduce their number of shots.  if tied in score, those two balls repeat the  hoop, as a shoot out.)<br />
  After  each Hoop, child gets given a letter, and after the course, gets to make a  word.</p>
<p>Learning  on the Line and with a Gauge O rail through a hoop<br />
      Wide  Hoops</p>
<p>earning  the Two ball shot, for fun using the Pizza, the Stencil, the <br />
      Spaghetti  hoops and a co-operative game with 4 children.</p>
<p><img src="Images/PastedGraphic-1.jpg" width="253" height="449" alt="circuit" /></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img src="Images/PartB_clip_image017.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <p>The  Mini Croquet Course Which is two ball set up and then they hit a single ball  through a hoop, then a shot closer to the next stencil or set up.  The second ball goes on a separate adventure,  maybe through a wide hoop or hitting a wall, etc.  Hoops as Historical Icons.</p>
<p>Activities  involving the two ball shot, such as Space Invader.  This to develop into a Two ball game.</p>
      <p><strong>Primary Program Two :</strong> Also Active After Schools&nbsp;&nbsp;8 years plus.<br />
        Start  with Long and Short, then some Puzzle, and then Golf OK, but mainly an attempt  to get them to Puzzle. &nbsp;Two ball shot becomes 'assessed'.<br />
      Competition  OK, determination OK, no aggression.</p>
<p>After  each Hoop, child gets to pick up a word, and at the end of the course, creates  a sentence.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Secondary Programs :</strong> &nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>General : </strong>There  has been a lot of experience with Secondary Schools.  We need to begin to get Malletsports in as a  Sport of Choice, and know that School Coaches and Physical Education Teachers  can also coach the game.</p>
      <p>The  goal here needs to be to get Students playing one of our two more complex  games, Association or Gateball.  This can  be achieved by a pathway approach, using Puzzle Croquet.</p>
      <p>If  starting : some long and short, then both Golf and Puzzle, with assessed two  ball shots and extra coaching. &nbsp;To arrive at Puzzle, so they can go to  'State' level of Association or Gateball. &nbsp;Learn breaks to be assessed for  quality and scored for ball movement.<br />
        Competition,  Determination and Aggression OK.</p>
      <p>Our  State Associations will need to put on Championships for these students, at the  different levels they are on the Malletsports Pathway.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img src="Images/PartB_clip_image019.gif" alt="" /></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>A Create Your Own Club  Program :</strong> important for many VELS.</p>
      <p><strong>VET PROGRAM :</strong> We intend to develop with partnership schools some VET programs.  This will include Group Dynamics, to lead to  Coaching, Life Coaching, and Organisational Dynamics  pathways.  We will need to work hard to  get a course written up and approved by the relevant authorities.  This is a long term project.</p>
