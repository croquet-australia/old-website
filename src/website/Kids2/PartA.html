      <h2 align="center"><strong>PART A : GENERAL </strong><br />
        <strong>DRAFT ACA SCHOOLS  COACHING POLICY :</strong></h2>
      <p>The ACA supports the development of a National Schools Coaching System. Our Goal should be that every Malletsports  Club has access to the benefits of the National Schools Coaching System.  </p>
      <p>An  energetic Club with a lively Schools Program will attract the interest of  Parents and Government. The Policy recognises that Schools Coaching is a  specialist area of Coaching which requires training and certification.</p>
      <p><strong>The National Schools  Coaching System is made up of two parts :</strong><br />
        <strong>Programs </strong><br />
        <strong>and </strong><br />
        <strong>The Sustainable Coach  System.</strong></p>
      <p>The Programs will be written by the National Director of Schools   Coaching in consultation with the Advisory Committee for Schools   Coaching.</p>
      <p>We  accept that the content of the Program will be implemented in different ways in  different states because of Curriculum differences, and even by different Clubs  and Coaches as they have different mixes and interests.  We will attempt to provide Programs which are  rich enough to satisfy most needs.</p>
      <p><strong>The Sustainable Coach  System :</strong> <br />
        In  addition to the Programs, we hope to create a system of Schools Coaching which  might be sustainable, and overcome the lack of personnel who are trained and  certificated.  We anticipate that if  Clubs choose to empower themselves to implement the system, that either the  National Director of Schools Coaching, or a possible National Sports  Development Officer, will assist.  This  might also be via the State Directors of School Coaching, and their Sports  Development Officers.<br />
        This  Policy sees Sustainability being created by moving the potential stream of  income from Schools Coaching to a Professional Coach in each club.  In time, their efforts may also be  supplemented by VET students who are putting time in for their experience.  </p>
      <p>In  addition, there is the Active After-School Community Program, which is well  funded and will also mean Clubs can employ young graduates or students or  retirees to be the Schools Coach.<br />
        As  in tennis, these Coaches could be expected to help with other club needs, such  as management, welcoming or Coaching.</p>
      <p>With  the Collaboration of the National Director of Schools Coaching, a National  Sports Development Officer, the State Directors of Schools Coaching and the  State Sports Development Officers, and the National Advisory Committee for  Schools Coaching, a Program and a Sustainable Coach System can be created for  Clubs who choose to empower themselves to implement.</p>
      <p>Clubs  which choose to empower themselves to create a Sustainable Coaching system,  will need the help of the Director of Coaching for how a Schools Program works,  and its content, and also need the help of an SDO to help them get in touch  with Schools, find and employ a young coach, and help them start their business.  &nbsp;That Coach will hopefully earn enough to also do some of the Club  Coaching.</p>
      <p><strong>MARKETING AND  DOCUMENTATION :</strong> <br />
        This  Policy will have to be backed up by written material, video and coaching aides.  We will also need a Marketing Campaign and Strategy to enable a Club or Coach  employed by a Club to get a number of Schools in. We will need template  advertisements for Coaches, contracts, and documents outlining ideal  relationships between Club and Professional Coach.      </p>
      <p>END  OF POLICY      </p>
      <h3><strong>OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROGRAMS  AND THE SUSTAINABLE COACH SYSTEM</strong> <br />
    </h3>
      <p>Our  Programs have to respond to opportunities which have opened up.<br />
        The  Government is keen to see students participating in sports on a regular basis,  for health, recreation, personal development and as an adjunct to learning  disciplines, and as an adjunct to the development of thinking and creative  skills.  Governments are seeing education  as the beginning of a whole of life learning pattern.  They are also seeing education starting from  Pre-school and are removing the boundaries that have traditionally existed.</p>
<p>The  National Curriculum for sport has not been set yet, but some states have moved  forward.  Victoria has a Victorian  Essential Learning Standards policy which is in keeping with contemporary  educational thinking.  We have to present  our sport as a response to such policies.</p>
      <p>In  addition, there are opportunities for Secondary Students to study subjects like  Malletsports and get credit for their work.   We can even look to partnership with particular schools to create  Academies of Malletsports.  These  Students move onto TAFE and then University to undertake Sport and Recreation  Courses.</p>
      <p>Our  Policy also realises that we now have problems from an older hopeful but naive  approach.  This came from goodwill in the  1990’s from organisations such as the Australian Sports Commission.  It meant that many coaches and members of  clubs were seen as able to coach schools.   However, Governments now insist on Certification for Working with  Children, and training for Coaching Children is also needed.  Malletsports does not have the volunteer  capacity to undertake a systematic Schools Program.      </p>
      <h3><strong>OPPORTUNITIES FOR  MALLETSPORTS NOT YET GRASPED</strong> <br />
      </h3>
      <p>You  don't go to the pool to be told you can only swim : you might want to dive, or  play water volleyball. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>You  don't go to the snow to be told you can only walk up hill with skies on. You  want to race down, or get a snowboard, or cross country, or race.</p>
      <p>These  are whole sports worlds.<br />
        You  shouldn't be coming to Malletsports and be told you can only play croquet.<br />
        We  must be a Sports for all : with games and activities that as diverse as people  want : some target, some invasion, some etc.</p>
      <p>This  is very evident in the range of games and activities we need to provide for  Schools Programs and the Active After-Schools Community Program.  If we want to be one of the sports with a  separate Booklet in this program, we will have to think from a much larger view  of our Malletsports World.</p>
      <h3><strong>RATIONALE OF NATIONAL  SCHOOLS COACHING SYSTEM</strong><br />
        </h3>
      <p>The  Rationale for this National Schools Coaching System is :<br />
        There  are not enough coaches to do this work.<br />
        This  is not going to change.<br />
        We  have not got far enough into the School Curriculum and been seen as an Answer  to the needs of Schools and Teacher.</p>
      <p>Sadly,  the lack of coaches also applies to general coaching in the Clubs for existing  members.</p>
      <p>The  Two ball shot has never been taught at the Schools level, and this is a huge  marketing and educational mistake.  It is  our greatest asset.</p>
      <p>We  have to understand  Contemporary Educational Theory,  or the new Curriculum, national  and state.</p>
      <p>We  have to understand that School aged children do not need competitive or  aggressive play till later in their development.</p>
      <p>Learning  needs to be based on experiential, fun, discovery, problem-solving.      </p>
      <h3><strong>OVERVIEW</strong> <br />
      </h3>
      <p>By  creating a Whole of Life Coaching Program, we can provide coaching to Schools  and by allowing a trained coach to access the stream of income produced by a  Schools Program, we can get Coaching of an acceptable standard for Schools, and  this may also lead to coaching for Club members.</p>
      <p>The  main obstacles are that the current club members may not accept the idea of a  professional or paid coach.  Instead,  they will question the value of a Schools program, and demand all resources be  put into Coaching existing members.  This  will not happen.</p>
      <p>I  have in this report concentrated on outlining possible Whole of Life Learning  Schools Programs and how a Club could recruit and appoint a Coach, and develop  a relationship with them.  The outlined  draft is comprised suggestions for marketing to schools, advertising for  coaches, and the beginnings of programs.   These are presented with Children’s characters and as normal development  programs.  </p>
      <p>I  believe we are not in a position to debate whether or not we need to adopt the  Sustainable Coach system I am describing.   We are already many years behind.</p>
      <p>And,  there is much work to be done.  I have  arranged for us to actually be a constituent sport in the Active After-Schools  Community Program, and we need to complete the Programs.  We also have to accept diversity in the  execution of the programs, and in the sports a particular club or coach might  want to coach. The real driving force for the progress of the sport is  enthusiasm. To this end, I have recommended an Advisory Committee to help  create what we need.</p>
      <p>I  would recommend that we look at the work of the following sports :<br />
        Tennis  : This sport has a fully developed system, where Club Coaches are seen as the  backbone of a Clubs, and they are helped in the development of small  businesses, on the understanding that they are there to welcome new members,  and coach more skilled ones.<br />
        Football  : Both Australian Rules and Rugby even have Academies attached to Secondary  Colleges, where student undertake VET and in that, they visit and coach Primary  School Children.</p>
      <p>We  have a great sport in Malletsports, and need to communicate that better.<strong></strong></p>
