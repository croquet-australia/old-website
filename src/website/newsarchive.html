                            <p>The Australian Croquet          Association,          through its Senior Vice-President Neil White, sent its          condolences to the          family of Jean Armstrong on her death this week, together with          its very warm          appreciation of all Jean has done for croquet at every level:          club, State,          national and international. </p>
                            <p>Jean was a Life Member          of the          Brighton Croquet Club, whose clubrooms were named Armstrong          House.  At the State          level the Jean Armstrong Shield          has attracted a top field of women players to South Australia          each year since          1998.  Even in the          competition last year          Jean was involved in selecting invitees.           Many of the Jean Armstrong Shield players are among their          top State          players and became known personally to Jean over the years.  Jean keenly followed their          progress. </p>
                            <p>As an example of Jean's          involvement          at the national level, the ACA conducts the Jean Armstrong Bowl          competition for          the Women's Eights as part of the annual AC President's Eights. </p>
                            <p>At the international          level the ACA          wishes to pay tribute again to Jean's induction into the World          Croquet          Federation's Hall of Fame in 2008.           In          2012, at the age of 99, Jean attended the opening ceremony of          the World          Association Croquet Championships in Adelaide and met the WCF          President Amir          Ramsis.  She also renewed          her          acquaintance with many of the international competitors.  Much to her delight the then          ACA Senior          Vice-President Greg Diprose visited her the following day with          the Wimbledon          Cup trophy. Jean treasured the photo of her holding this trophy.  Jean's centenary was          acknowledged on the WCF          website. </p>
                            <p>No-one could have been          more devoted          to the cause of croquet at every level, and the Australian          Croquet Association          honours her for this </p>

There is also a high probability that additional places will become available as other countries do not take up their full allocations.  Plus there are at least six wild cards (available to players from all countries) and another four places available for people that play in the Qualifier. Players wishing to be considered for selection should make their availability known to the Chairman of AC Selectors, Trevor Bassett (<a href="mailto:tbassett@msfp.net.au">tbassett@msfp.net.au</a>) before 31 May 2012.</td>
