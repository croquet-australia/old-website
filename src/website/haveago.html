      <h2>What's Croquet All 
        About </h2>
      <p class="style3 style4">Browse through our web site and see 
        what you think! </p>
      <p class="style3 style4">There is information on the <a href="How_To_Play/index.html">basic 
        rules</a>, and <a href="Where_To_Play_Croquet/index.html">Croquet in Australia</a>, 
        also a brief <a href="history.html">history</a>.</p>
      <p class="style3 style4">&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>How To Get 
        Started </h2>
      <p class="style3 style4">So now you've realised what a great 
        game croquet is you want to get started! </p>
      <p class="style3 style4">Firstly see if there is a croquet 
        <a href="Where_To_Play_Croquet/index.html">club near you</a>. All states  have web sites which lists a range of contact 
        people, others you might need to phone or fax. They will be able to give 
        you plenty of information about the game and how to get started. </p>
      <h2>Want to buy 
        some equipment to play in the backyard?</h2>
      <p class="style3 style4">The States can give you all the information 
        you need about where to buy equipment throughout the country. </p>
      <h2>Already playing 
        but having some problem with the rules? </h2>
      <p class="style3 style4">Definitely worth visiting a club 
        and see how we play. Croquet players are notoriously gregarious, they 
        love to talk to anyone who puts their head over the fence! </p>
      <h2>What about 
        some lessons?</h2>
      <p class="style3 style4">Not a problem; most clubs offer a 
        range of lessons for beginner. </p>
      <h2>Do I have 
        buy much equipment and is it expensive? </h2>
      <p class="style3 style4">All you need to start with are flat 
        soled shoes. You can borrow club mallets and then once you have worked 
        out which one you like you will probably want to buy your own - cost is 
        around $100 to $200.
