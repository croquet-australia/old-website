      Roque is a great and historical game. There are a few courts still in existence, 
      scattered across the country. Roque is still played at a few locations in 
      the United States, played the same way it has been for over 100 years. It's 
      a version of nine-wicket croquet, usually played on hard sand with a raised 
      border that the balls can carom off. 
      <p> There is still a national roque organization, but it is loosely run 
        and I have never succeeded in getting a copy of the rules even though 
        I tried for several years. 
      <p> The strongest group I've heard of is the Angelica, New York, group. 
        Try contacting Paul Gallmann at (716) 406-7676 or David Haggstrom at (716) 
        466-7930. My phone numbers are several years old. 
      <p> Barty Johnson in Texas makes roque balls and mallets. He'll probably 
        be able to give you good leads and more information: (806) 894-6652. <br>
