      </center>      <p> Peel Appeal looks at the triple peel as seen from the experiences Steve 
        has acquired over the years with the help of some of New Zealand's leading 
        players. The matches described are some of the most fascinating and exciting 
        that have ever been played. An interesting and amusing anecdotal account 
        of New Zealand and World Croquet over the past 15 years, the book also 
        serves as an invaluable coaching guide both for beginners and more expert 
        players. 
      <p> "In the second game [of the 1995 Trans Tasman test match], I somehow 
        ended up on hoop 4 after Bruce [Fleming] had again raced away to 4-back. 
        This put quite a bit of pressure on me and by this time, the other three 
        matches had finished and all eyes were on my game! This made things very 
        tense and nerve-racking - but Bruce was feeling it too! I hit a long one 
        and had a three ball break in front of me but the nerves struck as I blobbed 
        hoop 4 from close range! Mercifully, Bruce couldn't improve his score 
        from that and I was the first to recover my composure. I hit back and 
        this time did a good break to 4-back. Bruce wasn't finished yet, though. 
        He hit the lift and advanced his 4-back ball to rover - but I wasn't finished 
        yet either....!" 
      <p> The book begins by describing Steve's own beginnings in Croquet and 
        the first triples completed by Steve and others. The mechanics of the 
        triple peel is covered comparatively briefly but gives the reader the 
        basics of the various leave options and where to place the balls for each 
        peel. Famous (and not so famous) triples (and failed triples) are discussed 
        as well as TPO's, 3-ball triples, sextuples and even octuples. There are 
        lengthy sections on Test Match Croquet (both MacRobertson Shield and Trans 
        Tasman) and on who the best Croquet might be (or might have been). The 
        book ends with a Chapter on some aspects of the future of Croquet. Diagrams 
        and photographs (many in colour) complete this fully indexed book, the 
        first to be written by a New Zealander since the 1940's. 
      <p> Contributions from Ashley Heenan, Bob Jackson, John Prince, Paul Skinley, 
        Aaron Westerby and many other leading New Zealand players give this book 
        added interest, and the Foreword by Charles Jones, JP contains some classic 
        stories of his own! 
      <p> "...in partnership with Gordon Rowling, we won the Doubles Championship 
        [British Open Doubles, 1974, Hurlingham]. In the third game of the final 
        I well remember doing a triple starting on hoop 2 with one ball in corner 
        1. Maurice Reckitt writing in "Croquet" called it a "majestic triple". 
        - John Prince. 
      <p> Hopefully this book contains something for everyone - this is certainly 
        the intention. Although I discuss at length matches played at tournaments 
        such as the MacRobertson Shield and the World Championships, people not 
        aspiring to these heights as players will be able to follow the action 
        with ease as the subject of peeling has been gently introduced in the 
        early chapters. It is a book that will complement the coaching manuals 
        by giving an alternative view of playing techniques. In particular, it 
        chronicles ways of playing the game that cannot be found in the manuals 
        because the players concerned have used that all-important but indefinable 
        quality "inspiration" to strut their stuff. 
      <p> "....The ritual began again. Surely this time the answer would become 
        plain and the fate of both players satisfied. Yes, this time it must be. 
        Never in the history of this great competition has so much depended on 
        such a small moment, it seemed. The British players had stopped in their 
        deliberations on adjacent lawns and were breathing thinly, waiting for 
        the moment. The Kiwis had ceased their stirring too but were breathing 
        not calmly but with a panting that gave away their apparent nonchalance. 
        The Americans' and Australians' pace too had slowed as had the chinking 
        of tea cups long since discarded into their saucers. It was as if time 
        was standing still in the mini-world of Croquet at Cheltenham. Burridge 
        is swinging now, this is the moment, the moment is upon us....."
