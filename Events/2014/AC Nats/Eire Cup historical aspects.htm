        <p align="left"> Australian Croquet Association President, Ms Robyn Wallace, Vice-President, Mr Neil White, Treasurer, Mr Jim Clements, and Honorary Secretary, Mr Steve Thornton,</p>
        <p align="justify">Croquet Queensland President, Mr Doug Williams and Vice-President, Ms Valda Wintzer,</p>
        <p align="justify">Chief Executive Officer, Sports Federation of Queensland, Mr Peter Cummiskey,</p>
        <p align="justify">Tournament Manager, Mr Bruce McAlister, and Tournament Referee, Mrs Elizabeth Fleming,</p>
        <p align="justify">State Team Representatives, players, officials, supporters and guests,</p>
        <p align="justify">Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
        <p align="justify">Thank you for the invitation to join you this evening for this very special celebratory dinner and prize presentation, bringing to a pleasurable close what I trust has been a very pleasurable - if hard-fought - round of tournaments, of individual and team competition in the 2014 Association Croquet National Championships.</p>
        <p align="justify">As Governor of Queensland and as Patron of Croquet Queensland I am delighted that our State is once again host to this prestigious competition and I compliment Croquet Queensland - in particular, the tournament hosts, Brisbane North and Brisbane South regions and Tournament Manager, Bruce McAlister, on the excellent arrangements made, and thank everyone who contributed to its success, who worked so hard to ensure that everything ran as smoothly as possible in all match locations, and to offer to our interstate visitors the very warmest of Queensland welcomes.</p>
        <p align="justify">I hope that some of you may have taken - or be able to take now - the opportunity to explore our city and discover some of its attractions and interesting places, beyond the clubs and lawns that have absorbed your attention so thoroughly over recent days competing in the various championships and of course, vying for the coveted Eire Cup.</p>
        <p align="justify">Anyone who knows me or has heard me speak at diverse events across the State during my five and half years as Governor, including at Croquet Queensland events, knows that I have a deep interest in history and also an abiding curiosity about words and their associations.  So when Croquet Queensland President, Doug Williams, invited me to present the Eire Cup, I was immediately curious to know why a trophy with an Irish name has come to hold pride of place in an Australian national competition.  My curiosity only deepened when I learned that the inscription on this beautiful bowl actually reads &lsquo;Irish International Eire Cup'.  As a former career diplomat, dedicated to promoting greater international understanding and harmonious relations between different countries and cultures, and also knowing of the penchant of Australians, including Australian sportsmen and women, to &lsquo;souvenir' items when travelling abroad (remember Dawn Fraser and the famous incident of the Olympic flag she stole from outside the Emperor's Palace in Tokyo?) I was a bit worried that the Cup's presence in Australia might involve some similar shenanigans or &lsquo;high jinks' that could strain our relations with Ireland, but no - obviously there are no larrikins among croquet players (!) - and the Cup, I was happy to find, travelled to Australia not like that famous flag, tucked inside a track suit, or under a croquet club jacket, but in a totally legitimate and proper way.</p>
        <p align="justify"><em>Most of you here will know its origins and thus its significance, I assume, but for those who don't, it was won in Dublin, Ireland, in 1937 by an Australian team and was carried proudly back to Australia and stored at the headquarters of Croquet Victoria.  (I thought that might have been because Victoria was the home of the first State Croquet Association, but actually the very first Australian State Association to be formed was in Tasmania in 1908, also, interestingly, the first place where the game was reported as being played in Australia, mentioned in the Tasmania's &quot;Walch's Literal Intelligencer&quot; in 1861; the Victorian Croquet Association was the second to be formed, in 1914, so I can only assume that one or some of the members of that winning Australian team were Victorians).</em></p>
        <p align="justify"><em>As far as I can establish, the Cup was first awarded in interstate competition, in Sydney in 1942 - still presumably being looked after by the Victorians.  Then, when the Australian Croquet Council was formed in 1949, the Cup became its property and has been presented, on behalf of the ACA ever since, as one of the sport's most prestigious prizes.</em></p>
        <p align="justify"><em>The prestige it enjoys today attaches to the skill of the teams involved.  This is Association Croquet at its best (strategic and technically challenging), but the Cup does have added significance, I suggest, because of its history - not so much its history here in Australia, since 1937, but with Ireland and its connection to the historic Carrickmines Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club in Dublin, considered by many to be the worldwide &lsquo;home of croquet'.</em></p>
        <p align="justify"><em>Whilst purists might dispute the claim, tracing mallet and ball games back to the Middle Ages, Ireland firmly asserts its place as the location where modern croquet was invented in the 1830's and the Carrickmines Club, founded in 1903, as the leading venue for international matches and larger tournaments.</em></p>
        <p align="justify"><em>The Eire Cup was introduced at Carrickmines in 1928 to celebrate a Mrs Wilson, who had spearheaded the group that had established the club twenty-five years earlier.  They must have been well-financed at the time - or in an especially expansive mood - because they ordered four identical, handsome cups, three of which are still competed for in Ireland - and the fourth is right here, thanks to that 1937 match between Australia and Ireland being declared a &lsquo;one-off', with the winning team able to retain the trophy.  I suspect the Irish might regret that decision, but their loss was our gain, and continues as such to this day.</em></p>
        <p align="justify"><em>86 years since it was crafted on the other side of the world, 77 years since it landed in Australia, 72 years since it was first presented as an interstate competition trophy, this &lsquo;Eire Cup' indeed has a rich history which I hope will add to the pleasure of those champions who tonight will become its custodians for the next twelve months, until next year in Sydney, where the country's best croquet players will once again take up their mallets to participate in these national championships and the fun will start all over again! </em></p>
        <p align="justify">And on that happy note, I extend warm congratulations to all those players and teams receiving prizes tonight, and to everyone who participated in the different tournaments and competitions in the spirit of sportsmanship and camaraderie and respect for others' skills and prowess, that seems to me the hallmark of this sport; I wish you all continued enjoyment of its challenges and pleasures, as I wish everyone present a most enjoyable evening.</p>
